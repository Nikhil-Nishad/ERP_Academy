# Introduction

As enterprises accelerate their digital transformation journeys and migrate critical business processes to the cloud, security has evolved from a perimeter-based concern to a comprehensive, multi-layered discipline that must protect data, applications, and infrastructure across complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments. The traditional approach of securing a defined network perimeter has become obsolete in an era where employees, customers, and partners access enterprise resources from anywhere, on any device, at any time.

SAP Cloud Security 2025 addresses this fundamental shift by implementing a zero-trust security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously validates every transaction, user, device, and application. This approach, combined with advanced threat detection, automated compliance management, and intelligent security orchestration, provides enterprise-grade protection that scales with business growth while maintaining the agility and innovation benefits of cloud computing.

Organizations implementing comprehensive SAP Cloud Security strategies report significant improvements: 70% reduction in security incidents, 60% faster threat detection and response times, 50% reduction in compliance costs, 45% improvement in user experience through seamless security, and 80% reduction in security management overhead through automation. These outcomes demonstrate that security and business agility are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary when properly implemented.

## The Evolution of Cloud Security

### From Perimeter to Zero-Trust Security

Traditional security models relied on the concept of trusted networks and untrusted external environments, creating a hard perimeter around corporate assets. This approach has become fundamentally flawed in cloud environments where data, applications, and users exist across multiple locations, devices, and networks. Zero-trust security eliminates the concept of trusted networks and instead verifies every interaction based on multiple factors including identity, device health, location, behavior patterns, and risk assessment.

### The Shared Responsibility Model

Cloud security operates under a shared responsibility model where cloud providers secure the infrastructure and platform layers while customers are responsible for securing their data, applications, and user access. Understanding and properly implementing this division of responsibility is crucial for maintaining comprehensive security across the entire cloud stack.
